- Languages used: Python

## Groupwork Practicals: Groupwork Practical on Align DNA sequences, Groupwork Practical on Missing oaks problem

### [align_seqs_better.py]

This script reads two DNA sequences from FASTA files, aligns them, and finds the best alignment based on a custom scoring function. It outputs all the best alignments with their respective scores and saves them to a binary file using the pickle module.

**Input:**  
Two DNA sequences from FASTA files (defaults: `../data/407228326.fasta`, `../data/407228412.fasta`) or passed via command line arguments.

**Output:**  
- Binary file containing all the best alignments and scores (`../results/my_best_match`).
- Console output showing the best alignments with corresponding sequences and scores.
